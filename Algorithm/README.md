<h2> Forward Algorithm </h2>
Forward algorithm aims to calculate probability of observable sequence based on given HMM model with less number of computation compared with direct calculation methode. This algorithm also calculate alpha variable that being used in Baum-Welch algorithm to estimate HMM model specification.

<h2> Backward Algorithm </h2>
Backward algorithm aims to calculate backward variable that being used in Baum-Welch algorithm to estimate HMM model specification.

<h2> Baum-Welch Algorithm </h2>
Baum-Welch algorithm aims to re-calculate HMM model parameter such as initial probability (pi), state transition probability (a), and emission probability (b) using initial HMM model parameter. This algorithm will repeat the training process until the parameter converges in a certain value.

<h2> Viterbi Algorithm </h2>
Viterbi algorithm aims to determine hidden states sequence based on HMM model and observable sequence.
